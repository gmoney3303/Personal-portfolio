# Personal-portfolio

## Description

this project is a website of my own personal portfolio. It will explain a little about me then it will give a list of my projects and contact info.
ALl of which you will be able to click to and acces. In the website you will be able to click to get to contact info work and about me then click ont the links about my work 
to go to an external link on my work. I learned a lot more on how to structure websites and how to use css in conjuction with html.
Another thing I learned is to better sketch things out I used way more divs than I thought I would and had to add them in after I had already wrote a lot of code causing thimgs to get messy.



## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
![alt text](assets/images/personal.PNG)

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

hoverable images that also have links they lead to when clicked on.
clicking on the "about me,work" in the top right will dirrect you to that part of the page.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
